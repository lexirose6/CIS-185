## 6. Challenges faced
Including JavaScript and working with the form I created for the Suggestions page was a bit of a challenge. I had to look-up how to add an alert through W3Schools. Less of a challenge but was time-consuming was looking up all the recipies I wanted to include on my website and all of the pictures to go with the recipies.
