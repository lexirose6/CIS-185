# Manual vs Bootstrap Implementation

**Name**: Alexia Wells

**Class:** CIS185

## Development time 

It took me around 2 1/2 hours to develop the first part of this assignment. It took me 1 hr 20 mins to devolope my portfolio with bootstap.

## Code Comparison

Both html files have grid layouts. 
`.grid-container` was used for the manual and `.container` was used with bootstrap. The classes used in the manual were custom made, while the classes used in the bootstrap were pre-made. The classes referring to the grid layout in the CSS, for the manual, were a bit similar to the row size classification in the bootstrap html file. 

For example: 

`class="project-header"` (manual CSS)  and `class="col-12"` (bootstrap) did viturally the same thing. Both were a block and the length of the whole screen. 

The custom grid layout in CSS did not use numbers to determine the row sizes, it used keywords to divide the rows. Bootstrap uses math to divide the rows. 


## Pros / Cons of each approach

**Manual CSS Pros:**

- Using CSS you can customize your website.

**Manual CSS Cons:**

- You have to add in the breakpoints manually.
- Takes much longer to style your website. 

**Bootstrap Pros:**

- It's easier to layout your website
- Cleaner layout
- Breakpoints are pre-added

**Bootstrap Cons:**

- Can't customize your website much without CSS.

## Personal Preference

I like that I can customize the websites I make however I want with CSS, but I also like the user friendly bootstap with the built in classes. To save development time I would prefer to use Bootstrap.
