## Challenges faced
Connecting the pages with the navagation bar was difficult, I had to use outside sources to help me solve the problem via a router. I had a problem with implementing a carousel for each project page due to react bootstrap having a different syntax to what I'm familiar with. I used outside sources to help with getting it right. Coming up with a design and styling for the portfolio was not easy, I ended up styling it simple. At the begginning of the project I had moved the react app to a different folder which had messed with the dependencies, so I used outside sources to figure out the problem and solve it with the command `npm i`.
