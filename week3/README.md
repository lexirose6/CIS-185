## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of grid layouts along with the use of flex. This project includes grid layouts, use of css styling, and images.

## Within CSS Stylesheet
`.grid-container`

This is the class I used to layout my grid areas. The grid layout had 2 columns with 6 rows.

`.grid-container > div`

This was the parent container.

`.grid-container > div.[...]`

These are the chilren containers which I used to style the individual grid points. 

`.inner-flex`

I used the flexbox to add individual components within the grid system. I used this class for my contact info and the image next to the 'About Me'.

`.inner-flex > div`

I added the class .inner-flex within the <div\> tag, which was within the specified grid area. This added two flexbox components stacked ontop of eachother, each one was specified within a nested <div\> tag.

## Within HTML file

`<div>` 

Within each tag there was a class which specified which grid area was being used.
