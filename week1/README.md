    <u>

**Purpose:** Underlining text within the tag.

**Why it's used:** This is used to indicate important text or make something stand out. 

    <br>
**Purpose:** To line break.

**Why it's used:** This is used to break up a line. It's useful for readability or to make certain things stand out. 

    <ruby>

    <strong>

## CSS Styling
The elements that have CSS styling applied are:

- \<body>: Added background color.
- \<h1>: Added a different font
- \<p>: Changed the font color
- \<ruby>: Made the font smaller, and made the font _italic_

## Learning Outcomes
I learned how to make checkboxes and while researching that, I learned that you can save the checkboxed values and submit it to a form. 

I also learned the handy \<br> tag, and how to make a Markdown file.
